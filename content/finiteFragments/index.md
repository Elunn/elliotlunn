description: Sand is a finite resource. This project attempts to highlight the issue by combining research with making. The process of creating glass from spelt concrete is one that seems almost impossible. However, the outcome is a glistening, indistinguishable piece of glass. This research process attempts to illuminate the material value trapped in the objects that we simply throw away.

	The world is running out of sand. Apart from water, sand is the most used resource by humankind, 50 billion tons is consumed every year. Concrete and glass could be considered pivotal uses of sand that have shaped the way modern society lives. These materials play an integral role in the structures we inhabit, to the objects we interact with on a daily basis. The construction industry's production of concrete is the main culprit of sand scarcity.
